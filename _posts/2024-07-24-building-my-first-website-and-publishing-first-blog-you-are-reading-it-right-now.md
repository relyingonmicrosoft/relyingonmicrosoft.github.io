title: Building your own website? Try free GitHub Pages with a free Jekyll theme...
---

Are you intimidated by tech? You want to build your own website, know you really ought to know how to do that already, but haven't done so before and don't know where to start?

Perhaps to compound your discomfort, you fear being displaced by artificial intelligence. People talk about it being a tool for greater productivity. Here is a humble example of how it can help any of us more confidently take our first step towards tech / programming self sufficiency.

This is a first attempt at building a website: I am sitting in my old university library, testing out AI (specifically, Perplexity, is the best chatbot I have found so far - effectively Open AI / chatGPT but with references and follow up questions/prompts and links to related content on the web - more on that in a future blog) and in just a few hours...

Here's what AI and I have done...


## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Create a new GitHub repository named `yourusername.github.io`.**

2. **Download the Lanyon theme:**
    - Go to [Lanyon Theme](https://github.com/poole/lanyon)
    - Click "Code" > "Download ZIP"
    - Extract the ZIP file on your computer

3. **Upload Lanyon files to your repository:**
    - On your repository page, click "Add file" > "Upload files"
    - Drag and drop all extracted Lanyon files
    - Commit changes

4. **Configure the theme:**
    - Edit `_config.yml`
    - Add: `remote_theme: poole/lanyon`
    - Update other settings as needed (title, description, etc.)

5. **Customize content:**
    - Edit `index.md` or `index.html` for your homepage
    - Modify or add posts in the `_posts` directory
    - Update `about.md` with your information

6. **Set up GitHub Pages:**
    - Go to repository Settings > Pages
    - Set source to "main" branch (or your primary branch)
    - Save changes

7. **Wait for GitHub to build and deploy your site (usually a few minutes).**

8. **Visit `https://yourusername.github.io` to see your live site.**

9. **For future updates:**
    - Edit files directly on GitHub or clone the repository locally
    - Commit and push changes
    - GitHub will automatically rebuild and deploy your site

Stay tuned for more adventures in tech and AI!
