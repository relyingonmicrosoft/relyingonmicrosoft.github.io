title: A Beginner's Guide to Creating Your First Website with GitHub Pages
---

Hello there! Are you interested in creating your very own website but feel overwhelmed by the technical jargon? Don't worry! This guide will walk you through the process, assuming no prior knowledge. We'll use GitHub Pages, which is free and relatively simple to set up.

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Account

1. Go to [GitHub's homepage](https://github.com/).
2. Click on the "Sign up" button in the top right corner.
3. Follow the prompts to create your account:
   - Enter your email address
   - Create a password
   - Choose a username (this will be part of your website's URL)
   - Solve the puzzle to verify you're human
   - Click "Create account"
4. Verify your email address by clicking the link GitHub sends you.

## Step 2: Create Your Website Repository

1. Once logged in, click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository".
2. Name your repository exactly as follows: `yourusername.github.io` (replace 'yourusername' with your actual GitHub username).
3. Make sure it's set to "Public".
4. Check the box that says "Add a README file".
5. Click "Create repository".

## Step 3: Choose a Theme

1. In your new repository, click on the "Settings" tab.
2. Scroll down to the "Pages" section in the left sidebar.
3. Under "Theme Chooser", click "Choose a theme".
4. Browse the available themes and select one you like (for example, "Minimal").
5. Click "Select theme".

## Step 4: Edit Your Website Content

1. After selecting a theme, you'll see a file called `index.md` open for editing.
2. Replace the content with your own. Here's a simple example:

   ```markdown
   # Welcome to My Website

   Hello! I'm [Your Name].
   This is my first website created using GitHub Pages.

   ## About Me

   ```

3. Scroll down and click "Commit changes".

## Step 5: View Your Website

1. Wait a few minutes for GitHub to build your site.
2. Open a new tab in your browser and go to `https://yourusername.github.io` (replace 'yourusername' with your GitHub username).
3. You should see your new website!

## Step 6: Make Further Changes (Optional)

1. To make more changes, go back to your repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the `index.md` file.
3. Click the pencil icon to edit.
4. Make your changes, then scroll down and click "Commit changes".

## Step 7: Adding Images (Optional)

1. To add an image, first upload it to your repository:
   - In your repository, click "Add file" > "Upload files"
   - Drag and drop your image or click "choose your files"
   - Commit the change
2. In your `index.md` file, add the image using this format:

```markdown
   ![Alt text for image](image-filename.jpg)
 ```

## Step 8: Adding a Table (Optional)

To add a table to your `index.md` file, use this format:

```markdown
| Header 1 | Header 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Row 1, Col 1 | Row 1, Col 2 |
| Row 2, Col 1 | Row 2, Col 2 |
 ```

Remember, each time you make changes, wait a few minutes for your site to update. 

Congratulations! You've created your very own website. 
As you become more comfortable, you can explore more advanced features and customizations. 
Happy web designing!
